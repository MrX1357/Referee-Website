                <p>In the diagrams, the ball is in rectangle 1. The Trail is responsible for
                    watching the play around the ball, particularly the player dribbling, shooting
                    or passing the ball and the defensive player or players guarding him. When
                    the ball is in this rectangle, the Trail has primary responsibility for on-the-ball
                    coverage.</p>

                <p>The Lead positions himself so that the ten players are between him and his
                    partner. His main responsibility is the play away from the ball. He should pay
                    particular attention to any possible illegal screens or rough post play.</p>

                <p>Lead has primary responsibility for off-the-ball coverage. By keeping his
                    hips open at approximately 45° to the play and approximately 1 metre from
                    the endline, he will be able to anticipate any possible movement of the ball
                    towards the basket and have a view of the players away from the ball.</p>

                <h4>Area 3</h4>
                <p>In the diagram, the ball is in rectangle 3 near the three-point line. In most cases
                    the ball will penetrate into rectangles 4 or 5 on a shot, pass or dribble. To
                    anticipate the action, the Trail must anticipate a move toward his left to
                    cover the play away from the ball.</p>

                <p>In the diagram, the ball is rectangle 3, to the Trail’s far right. Again, he has

                    responsibility for out-of-bounds decisions at the sideline or rectangle 3, but
                    he may sometimes be required to assist his partner.</p>

                <p>Trail will sometimes need help from the Lead to cover three-point field goal
                    attempts, especially when the defensive player blocks his angle of vision. If
                    a three-point field goal attempt is taken by a player straddling the free throw
                    line extended (rectangle 3 and 4), the Trail shall take responsibility for the
                    attempt.</p>

                <p>When the ball is in rectangle 3, the Lead again takes off-the-ball coverage.
                    He should always know where the ball is to give help, when necessary, to
                    his partner on a three-point field attempt. There is generally no need to move
                    beyond the three- point line to his left. He needs to adjust to a wide position,
                    approximately in-line with the widest view. With the ball in rectangle 3, the
                    Lead pays particular attention to the players in the low post area.</p>

                <p>When the ball is located in low rectangle 3 (hatched area),
                    referees should agree during the pre-game conference on how they can
                    communicate to decide who takes on-ball coverage and when. When the
                    Lead takes on-ball coverage, then the Trail should move towards his left in
                    order to cover the play away from the ball.</p>

                    to make decisions when the gall goes out-of-bounds near the sideline to his
                    left. He will also be able to indicate to his partner when a three-point field

                <h4>Area 5</h4>
                <p>When the ball moves into the restricted area, rectangle 5 (Hatched area), it is
                    the only occasion on which both officials will be looking at the play around
                    the ball, especially in shooting situations. The Trail also has to be especially
                    vigilant on rebounding situations, paying particular attention to the perimeter
                    players who may be trying to obtain the ball from an unfavourable position.</p>

                <p>The Lead official watches the play directly around the ball. He should focus
                    on the defensive player in all shooting or one-on-one situations (“referee the
                    defence”) but also be aware of the offensive player's actions.</p>

                    <p>As the Lead is the closest to the play, he is in the best possible position
                        to make decisions on all contact situations involving the shooter and the
                        defensive player guarding him. It is not his duty to watch the flight of the
                        ball. The Lead should not indicate goaltending or interference violations, and
                        generally not violations related to the ball striking the backboard support
                        structures. These are the responsibility of the Trail.</p>

                <h4>Area 6</h4>
                <p>In D25, the ball is now in the three-point field goal area. The Trail is primarily
                    responsible for the ball and the play around it, especially when a shot for a
                    field goal is attempted.</p>

                <p>When the ball is wide in rectangle 6 (shaded area), the Lead has the primary task for
                    off-the-ball coverage. In particular, he watches the low post areas as well as
                    all other players away from the ball, especially those involved in screening
                    situations</p>

                    the endline, the Trail will stay with the play until the end and the lead will
                    position himself to assist with this play.</p>

                <p>In principle Trail is responsible for signalling all 3-point attempts and all successful 3-point field goals. Below
                    you will find some practical cases and their procedure:</p>
                <!--Attempt 1-->
                <p>If an attempt is from rectangle 1,2 or 6 (green area):</p>
                    <li>Trail signals 3-point attempt</li>
                    <li>If basket is successful, the Trail signals the valid basket.</li>
                <!--Attempt 2-->
                <p>If an attempt is from low rectangle 3 (hatched area):</p>
                    <li>Trail signals normally the initial attempt signal but Lead can give help if there is doubt.</li>
                    <li>If basket is successful, only Trail signals the valid basket.</li>
                <!--Attempt 3-->
                <p>If an attempt is from Lead's side below the free throw line extended (rectangle
                    4 - blue area):</p>
                    <li>Lead signals 3-point attempt.</li>
                    <li>Trail mirrors the signal.</li>
                    <li>If basket is successful, only Trail signal the valid basket.</li>

                <p>The Trail official is primarily responsible for the flight of the ball. He must
                    determine if the ball has entered the basket by signaling it to the scorer's
                    table. The Lead official concentrates on situations away from the ball.</p>
                <p>It is always the official calling the foul who will decide whether a basket
                    should count. The other official should not indicate the success or otherwise of
                    the basket attempt unless necessary to assist his partner, for example:</p>
                    <li>The Lead official is unaware that the attempt has legally entered the basket.</li>
                    <li>Goaltending or interference has occurred</li>
                    <li>The ball has entered the basket illegally or as a second attempt</li>
                <p>Regardless of which official calls the foul, it is absolutely vital that the trail
                    official watches the flight of the ballto the basket, as well as the players
                    involved in the foul situation.</p>
