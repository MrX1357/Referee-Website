the direction of play that is to follow

If a foul is committed during the act of shooting (2 free-throws granted):
Signal: One arm with clenched fist, followed by indication of the number of
free-throws). Ensure each signal is individually shown. It should be seen as
two separate signals and not one. This means there is a pause between the
two signals

If a player is fouled before he starts his act of shooting:
Signal: One arm clenched fist, followed by pointing to the floor. Ensure each
signal is individually shown. It should be seen as two separate signals and not
one. This means there is a pause between the two signals.
Remember that there is no need to point the floor if the foul is not followed
by an act of shooting. For example, when a player is fouled when dribbling in
the backcourt.
