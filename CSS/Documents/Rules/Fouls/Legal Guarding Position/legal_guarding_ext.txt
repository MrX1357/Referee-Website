When guarding a player who controls
the ball, the elements of time and
distance do NOT apply. That means that
the player with the ball must expect to
be guarded and must be prepared to
stop or change his direction whenever
an opponent takes an initial legal
guarding position in front of him. The
defensive player can move backwards
or laterally, but not towards the player
with the ball.

When guarding a player who does not
control the ball, the elements of time
and distance shall apply. That means
that the defensive player cannot take
a position so near and/or quickly in the
path of a moving opponent. The distance
is proportional to the speed, but never
less than one normal step.
