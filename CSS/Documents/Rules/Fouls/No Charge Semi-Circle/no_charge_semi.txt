In assessing a charge / block / no call
relating to the no-charge semi-circle,
officials should consider the following
principles if contact occurs:
1. Is the offensive player in the air
2. Is the defensive player inside the
no-charge semi-circle area.

Adopting good officiating techniques
and refereeing the defence will allow
officials to identify the location of the
defender early and as such will increase
the accuracy in judging illegal contact.
As a general guide, where illegal
contact occurs in the restricted area,
officials are encouraged to signal the
foul without showing a secondary
signal. This will remove any chance of
conflicting calls signalled during double
call situations. It is the responsibility of
the officiating team to determine in the
pre-game conference the protocol
of which official will report to the
scorerâ€™s table.
