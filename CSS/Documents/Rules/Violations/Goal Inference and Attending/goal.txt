Goaltending occurs during a shot for a
field goal when a player touches the ball
while it is completely above the level of
the ring and
• It is on its downward flight to the basket,
or
• After it has touched the backboard.
In general play, whilst referees are
encouraged to stay with the play to
ensure a player in the act of shooting
is not illegally contacted, it is also
important to understand the next action
that needs to be officiated. One of those
actions is ensuring that illegal activity
does not occur that will affect the ball
from legally entering the basket.
In general play, this will usually be the
responsibility of the Trail. However,
in some cases, such as fast break
situations, the Lead, during transition
should have an awareness of where
the play is at and can assist in judging
goaltending and interference on his side
of the basket.
For Trail and Lead, during such
situations, both officials should be
considering the rules and be clear on
the differences between the two.
If the violation is committed by an
offensive player
• The basket is cancelled (if the ball has
entered the basket).
• The ball is awarded to the opponents
for a throw-in.
If the violation is committed by a
defensive player
• 1,2 or 3 points are awarded to the
offensive team.
