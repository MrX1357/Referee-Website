Whenever:
• A player in the backcourt gains control of a live ball, or
• On a throw-in, the ball touches or is legally touched by
any player in the backcourt and the team of that player
taking the throw-in remains in control of the ball in its
backcourt,
That team must cause the ball to go into its frontcourt
within 8 seconds.

The Trail official is responsible for
officiating the backcourt and for
determining whether the team in control
of the ball has caused the ball to go into
their frontcourt within 8 seconds.
The Trail referee is encouraged to adopt
the following procedures:
1. Check the game clock and shot clock to
ensure it is running.
2. Where a shot clock is clearly visible to
all participants, it is not necessary for
the trail official to signal a visual count
in the backcourt. Trail is still required to
maintain a mental count. If a violation
occurs, make the call when the shot
clock is on 15 seconds.
3. Where a shot clock is not visible or
not being used, the Trail official should
signal a visible count with the outside
arm whilst maintaining a mental count.
Officials are encouraged to regularly
practice their mental counting and to
measure their mental count against
a clock.
