In understanding that any player can
occupy any space on the court (as long
as he got there first), together with
employing good officiating techniques,
a referee will be best placed to see and
subsequently determine who caused the
illegal contact.

As a general rule a player is entitled to
the space on the floor he occupies and
the space above him (his cylinder). So,
if a player jumps in the air from a place
on the court he is occupying, he has
the right to land again in that space.
Often players will enter the cylinder of
an opponent player and this by itself is
not necessarily a foul. However, if illegal
contact occurs, the official will need to
judge who is responsible and whether it
should be called as a foul.
