A technical foul is a player non-contact
foul of a behavioural nature including,
but not limited to:
- Disregarding warnings given by officials
- Disrespectfully dealing and/or
communicating with the officials, the
commissioner, the table officials, the
opponents or persons permitted to sit on
the team benches
- Using language or gestures likely to
offend or incite the spectators
- Baiting and taunting an opponent
- Obstructing the vision of an opponent by
waving/placing his hand(s) near his eyes
- Excessive swinging of elbows
- Delaying the game by deliberately
touching the ball after it passes through
the basket or by preventing a throw-in
from being taken promptly
- Fake being fouled
- Hanging on the ring in such a way that
the weight of the player is supported by
the ring, unless a player grasps the ring
momentarily following a dunk shot or, in
the judgement of an official, is trying to
prevent injury to himself or to another
player

- Goaltending during the last free throw
by a defensive player. The offensive
team shall be awarded 1 point, followed
by the technical foul penalty charged
against the defensive player‚Äù

Referees are to deal with inappropriate
behaviour rather than ignoring it and
letting it affect the control and spectacle
of the game. Referees may prevent
technical fouls by giving a warning
or even overlooking minor infractions
which are obviously unintentional and
have no direct effect upon the game,
unless there is repetition of the same
action after a warning has been given.
Where a warning has been given for
inappropriate behaviour, any repetition
of this behaviour should be dealt with by
way of technical foul.

Players cannot have many technical or unsportsmanlike fouls
