“A foul is an infraction of the rules concerning
llegal personal contact with an opponent and/or
unsportsmanlike behaviour”

A player who has committed 5 fouls shall be
informed by the referee and must leave the game
immediately. The player is to be substituted as
quickly as possible.
The touching of an opponent is, in itself, not
necessarily a foul.
• Officials shall decide whether the illegal contact
has had an effect on the play. If contact caused by a
player in any way restricts the freedom of movement
of an opponent or forcibly moves an opponent, it is a
foul.
• When deciding on contact, the officials should weigh
up the following fundamental principles:
– The spirit and intent of the rules.
– Consistency and effect on the play. Establishing
early and maintaining the criteria from the first
call to the last call.
– Should not interrupt the flow of the game unnecessarily to penalise marginal contact. Call what
is obvious, and do not miss the big one (flies and
elephants).
Consistency in maintaining a balance between
game control and game flow, having a ‘feeling’ for
what the players are trying to do and calling what is
right for the game.
