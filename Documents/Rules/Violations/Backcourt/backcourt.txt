A team is in control of a live ball in its
frontcourt when:
• A player of that team is touching his
frontcourt with both feet while holding,
catching or dribbling the ball in his
frontcourt, or
• The ball is passed between the players
of that team in its frontcourt.

A team which is in control of a live in its frontcourt may not cause the ball to be illegally returned to its backcourt.

A team in control of a live ball in the frontcourt has illegally returned the ball to its backcourt, if a player of that team is the last touch the ball in his/her frontcourt and the ball is then first touched by a player of that team:
- Who has part of his/her body in contact with the backcourt
- After the ball has touched the backcourt of that team.

This restriction applies to all situations in a team's frontcourt, including throw-ins. However, it does not apply to a player who jumps from his/her frontcourt, establishes a new team control while still airborne and then lands with the ball in his/her team's backcourt.
