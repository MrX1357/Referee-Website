“A player cannot remain in his opponent’s restricted area
for more than three seconds”

Referees shall have in mind that there
are allowances when a player who is in
the restricted area:
• Makes an attempt to leave it
• Has one of his team-mates in the act
of shooting
• Dribbles to shoot for a field goal after
having been there for less than 3
consecutive seconds
