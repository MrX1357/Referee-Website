“A closely guarded player must pass, shoot or dribble the
ball within 5 seconds”

Referees are encouraged to referee the
defence and look for illegal actions.
This however cannot be at the expense
of recognising active legal defence
whilst closely guarding a player with
the ball. In such instances, referees are
encouraged to signal a visible count
using the arm on the outside of the play,
together with verbally supporting the
signal.
By doing so, it is providing a visual
image to other players and participants
that a person with the ball is being
closely guarded and if a five-second
violation occurs, it does not come as
a surprise when the referee makes
the call
