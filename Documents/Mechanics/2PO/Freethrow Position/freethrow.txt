During free-throws,
the Trail and the Lead are to
position themselves in the
front court consistent with the
general working areas.

The Trailâ€™s position during
the free-throw is generally on
the top of the free throw semi
circle line extended, close to
the sideline.

On the first free-throw,
the Trail shall pay attention that
the shooter does not commit a
violation by stepping over the
free-throw line. 

During the second
free-throw, the Trail shall pay
attention to the shooter but also
to the defensive players behind
the free-throw line extended
and behind the 3-point field
goal, and those in rebound
places on the right-side of the
shooter.
The Lead shall pay attention
to the defensive players in
rebound places in the left-side
of the shooter.
When a violation occurs during
the last or only free-throw, the
official is to blow the whistle
without delay to indicate a
violation has occurred (there is
no need to wait if the ball enters
the basket or not). If the ball
enters the basket, the whistle
is to be ignored allowing the
throw-in to occur (without the
official administering the ball).
